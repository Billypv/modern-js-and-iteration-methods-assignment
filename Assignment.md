# Modern JavaScript & Iteration Methods: Assignment

## Brief

Look into `./src/index..js` for assignment instructions. You are to refactor the existing code and apply what you have learned for this lesson on them.

**Example:**

Before ES6:

```js
function clone(source) {
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(source));
}
```

With ES6:

```js
const clone = (source) => ({ ...source });
```

## Submission Guidelines

- Cite any relevant sources consulted during your research
- Solve the problems using your own code
- Do not copy and paste solutions from the source material
